Here is how to the qdnetd file was made.  
This howto explains how qdnetd was created. All other
manpages should be made in a similar fashion.  Just
rename the files and follow the steps.

1) Make a text file similar to the qdnetd file

2) Run this command to create the file nroff needs
   to parse.  You can also view the output to ensure
   everything looks right.
sed -f make_manpage.sed qdnetd | tee qdnetd.tmp | less

3) Run this next command in order to make the man page
nroff -e -mandoc qdnetd.tmp | less -s

4) Run the command below in order to figure out what
   format your man pages are stored in.  It will either
   be bzip2 (bz2) or gzip (gzip).
MAN_FORMAT="`ls /usr/share/man/man1/a* | head -n 1 | sed -e 's/^[[:print:]]*\(bz2\)$/\1/' -e 's/^[[:print:]]*\(gzip\)$/\1/'`" && echo "Your man page format is: $MAN_FORMAT"

5) Move your file to the 8 category.
mv qdnetd.tmp qdnetd.8

6) If your man pages were stored in the bzip2 format then type:
bzip2 qdnetd.8
otherwise for gzip you need to type:
gzip qdnetd.8

7) Now move that manpage to the proper man page directory and
   category on the system (8 in our case) like so.  You will need
   to be root in order to do this.
cp qdnetd.8.bz2 /usr/share/man/man8/

8) Lastly you need to update your database so your system recognizes
   the new man page by running the following command.  You will also
   need to be root to do this.
updatedb

DONE!
