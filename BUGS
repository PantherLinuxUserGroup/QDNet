Known Bugs:
Turning off wireless card through hardware switch is seen as card being busy
Gentoo init script takes long period of time to end daemon
Starting qdnetworking before X starts results qdnet unable to find X session
So much happens in a loop that the timestamp forces all icons to be refreshed
Continuous "Network Disconnect" libnotify notifications (online test to sensitive)
	- I think this is happening because TRY_AGAIN starts as 0
	  so when you start off offline it thinks you dropped, setting
          TRY_AGAIN to 1 should fix this
	- While at it letting the qdhistory script automatically
	  connect you to a dropped network would be best, its simpler
Theres no way to tell qdnet only to list icons but not connect
	- If user clicked Disconnect then don't run qdhistory
Continuous "Still online" message from qdnetd (online test to insensitive)
Can't connect to ESSID's work a backslash in the name like "\x00"
